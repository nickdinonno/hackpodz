# Hackpodz
Containerized environment meant to simulate a Hack The Box challenge using Docker - from CY394 class project.

Users are provided with a Kali container and two vulnerable servers (an FTP and a MySQL server). Users must exploit the vulnerable services and capture the flag, simulating a Hack The Box experience.

A walkthrough and test of the lab infrastructure can be found in the labWalkthrough document.
